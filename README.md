# The-Prophecy

This is a web application that can help people see the connection amoong the currency data and trading world
information. With the machine learning algorithms we can also see the connection between data and news.

To run this website correctly you will have to install MongoDB first. And then switch to the folder that contains
requirements.txt, run "pip install -r requirements.txt".

If you have any problems, which is highly possible because actually this is just started, please make sure you email me at [andyafter@gmail.com].

For linux user(I am running on a mac) you will also have to make sure that you installed python-dev.
